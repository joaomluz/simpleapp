#Assuptions
In this app i im not using any framework as the email said to do it in "pure PHP".. 
But i assumed that it wold be necessary to create asynchronous requests to API
and because that i used "pure JavaScript" as well. :)

# Architecture
Its a simple MVC in pure PHP and JavaScript. It handle asynchronous the API requests with JavaScript and PHP create the routes, controllers and views. 

#Third-parts
Bootstrap 4

#TODO
Tests. I will probably use PHPUnit.
Handle AJAX erros. 
Create .Htaccess to pretty routes/urls
